# Hello Codepath!

This is the start of my first task within Codepath's Prework assignments.
This includes files from my creation of a Light and Sound Memory Game.

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: A description file using Markdown.

← `index.html`: This is the main HTML page for my site.

← `style.css`: CSS files add styling rules to my content.

← `script.js`: Interactivity to my site with JavaScript.
