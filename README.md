## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [x] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

**2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it?** (353 words)

One challenge that I encountered while creating this submission was implementing the guess function that I later compared and adjusted to reflect proper code quality and structure provided within the pre-work guide. Creating this specific function was a step into generating thought processes through Javascript that I have not had the opportunity to experience until this specific pre-work program. I had to access formatting structures from the recesses of my mind when I took my first object-oriented coding class of learning Java. While Javascript is not explicitly an object-oriented language there were some similarities in structure I was able to pick up on that I used to my advantage in breaking down the creation of this function to implement the code that would output the correct result. I read through the CodePath tips and explanation guides that have links to helpful websites that could help me to fully understand the code I needed to write. Another small challenge while completing this function as well as the individual files was how to structure my code to reflect proper code quality. I have experience in both Java and Python related courses that have each taught me new and unique ways to structure my code that is dependent on the specific language. Since this was one of my first times actively utilizing the Javascript language it was a small adjustment to research and be able to adapt my newfound learnings into each file. To overcome this challenge, I decided that I needed to learn more about some of the processes in generating these Javascript lines along with those that used CSS and HTML. One aspect that made this challenge easier to overcome was the vast amount of time I was able to utilize. I would do some work on my code, take notes, and then come back to do some research on any part that confused me. I was able to learn more about each specific part of Javascript, HTML, and CSS to a point that I feel confident in participating in more pre-work tasks with these languages to reflect on my newfound skills and knowledge.


**3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission?** (172 words)

One question I have about web development involves the use of the interface changing depending on one click. What connections are needed for a person to press a button on a web page to completely change the interface and design of that same page or to navigate it away from the page that it was currently on? This would add to the interactive aspect of a webpage that I am really curious to learn more about. The ability to quickly change a screen layout depending on a userâ€™s input and preferences would be the next step into thinking in terms of user accessibility that I strive to incorporate in my future technical work. Another question I have relates to how can I connect other programming languages in combination with Javascript, HTML, and CSS to create these webpages? I am still a beginner in the learning process of web development, so it would be nice to do more research on how different programming languages can contribute new and important elements to web development.


**4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific.** (282 words) 

If I had more hours to work on this project, I would spend some of that time implementing the leftover optional features listed above. Adding a timer that lets a player know how much time they have left to guess the pattern would be a great next step to have in my version of this game. I personally would love the look of a visual countdown that shows a player how many seconds they have left. This feature would allow for an organized game play with set rules and restrictions. In addition to a timer, I would like to continue to finish implementing these optional features by changing the type of tone that is played when pressing each button. I would like to make each specific audio sound that is associated with each button drastically different so that each sound that plays in a pattern is easily distinguishable. To make the game even more cohesive, I would pick audio snippets that somewhat relate to the picture that is shown when each specific button is pressed. The photos I included were pictures I took with my camera that heavily relate to nature, so I would have to get creative with the sounds I would eventually choose. Beyond these optional features, I would like to include additional features that I think of on my own. An additional feature that I would want to have is a game menu where a user can choose the difficulty of the game they want to play. This would require me to refactor certain functions to connect a level of difficulty button to a longer pattern with a shorter hold time that would differentiate by each difficulty level option.
