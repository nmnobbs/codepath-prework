## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [x] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (282 words) 

    If I had more hours to work on this project, I would spend some of that time implementing the leftover optional features listed above. Adding a timer that lets a player know how much time they have left to guess the pattern would be a great next step to have in my version of this game. I personally would love the look of a visual countdown that shows a player how many seconds they have left. This feature would allow for an organized game play with set rules and restrictions. In addition to a timer, I would like to continue to finish implementing these optional features by changing the type of tone that is played when pressing each button. I would like to make each specific audio sound that is associated with each button drastically different so that each sound that plays in a pattern is easily distinguishable. To make the game even more cohesive, I would pick audio snippets that somewhat relate to the picture that is shown when each specific button is pressed. The photos I included were pictures I took with my camera that heavily relate to nature, so I would have to get creative with the sounds I would eventually choose. Beyond these optional features, I would like to include additional features that I think of on my own. An additional feature that I would want to have is a game menu where a user can choose the difficulty of the game they want to play. This would require me to refactor certain functions to connect a level of difficulty button to a longer pattern with a shorter hold time that would differentiate by each difficulty level option.
